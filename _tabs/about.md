## About

Hello! I'm a Software Architect with over 16 years of experience in the tech industry, spanning multiple countries including Spain, the UK, and New Zealand. My career has not only been about developing solutions but also understanding the human elements that drive technology forward. Currently, I am based in Spain, working with IM Projects to innovate and streamline enterprise solutions.

**Global Experience and Technical Expertise**

Having worked internationally, I've gained a profound appreciation for the diverse approaches and challenges in software development. This global perspective enriches my approach as I tackle complex projects across various platforms. My technical toolset includes IDEs like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse, alongside a strong command over languages such as Java, Kotlin, and Python. This enables me to craft solutions that are not only effective but also intuitive and user-centric.

**Educational Journey**

I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. This builds on my background in Psychology and Commerce, providing a multidimensional view that influences my work significantly. Understanding the psychological underpinnings of user interactions and developer engagement in tech projects offers a unique lens through which I view software development.

**Blog Goals**

The main purpose of this blog is to save, share, and explore ideasâ€”ranging from technical innovations to the psychological dynamics at play in tech environments. I aim to delve into how the mindset of a developer, effective teamwork, and leadership in technology can impact project outcomes and innovation. This space will serve as a platform for discussion and discovery, where we can exchange knowledge and challenge our understanding of technology and the human factors that shape it.
