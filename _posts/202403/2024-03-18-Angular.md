# How to address the following error
Can't bind to 'ngForOf' since it isn't a known property of 'tr' (used in the 'OrderarchiveComponent' component template).
1. If 'tr' is an Angular component and it has the 'ngForOf' input, then verify that it is a part of an @NgModule where this component is declared.
2. To allow any property add 'NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA' to the '@NgModule.schemas' of this component.

There are a couple or references that are required on `app.module.ts` which helps Angular to do its magic on the related component:
