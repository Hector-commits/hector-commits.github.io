- Setting Up Automatic or Manual Imports.
- Creating Templates for Manual Imports.
- Linking Specific Credit Cards to Users.

# Set up user permissions

* System administrators should be configured with SUPER permission.
* These are the two main module permissions, note that they are complementary, only one should be assigned:
  
| **Permission Set** | **Description** 
|---|---|
| **CSC BASIC**| Grants access to all Continia Core features and allows tracking of Expense Management activation status. **All Expense Management users must have both CSC BASIC and CEM-ALL** permission sets to ensure full functionality of standard features.|
| **CSC APP SETUP**| Enables activation of Continia products, including Continia Core. Primarily used for product installation and managing subscription agreements in Business Central Online, such as selecting or deselecting subscribed modules. **Essential for online deployments**.|

[More about Permissions](http://go.continia.com/docs/en-us/em/linkid=em-62)

|Function|Example|Minimum BC license requirement|Set up on Continia User Setup|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Expense user**|User of the Expense Mobile App to submit expenses|No license required|Create as **Expense User** (dedicated boolean on *Continia User Setup Card*)|
|**Approver**|Oversees a number of employees|Team Member license|Indicate Unlimited approval limit or a specific amount|
|**Admin**|Accountant or HR manager|Essentials license|Create as **Approval Administrator**.|

At least one of the users should have the **Aproval Limit** set to **Unlimited**.
From the list with **Export Users** will send a welcome e-mail to the users with all the detail about how to log into the Application and the Web Portal.

We can link the **Continia User Setup** to a Vendor No. (this is recommended setup), but we can link it as well to a Employee No. If both are selected Employee takes prevalence and Employee Ledger Entries will be created.

# Delegate expense users
The Expense User delegation works similarly to Document Capture. It also can be easily set up on the Mobile App.

# Set up general features for expenses

There are three check to have in mind on the **Expense Management Setup**:
* **Auto submit for approval**: Set the expenses to go directly to the appover, otherwise they need to be supervised by the admin first.
* **Post in Expense Currency**: Specifies is expenses should be posted in the expense currency and not in the company currency. This is overruled if the bank account has a currency specified.
* **Copy Description from Transaction**: Specifies if the description should be automatically copied from the bank transaction.
